#When you start your app the current directory will be the directory above where the application is located. 
#For example: If you place the foo.app in the /Applcations folder then the current directory when you launch 
#the app will be the /Applications folder. Not the /Applications/foo.app/Contents/MacOS/ as you might 
#expect. 
#You can alter your app to account for this, or you can use this magic little launcher script that will change 
#the current directory and launch your app.

# I did not follow the rules and use -headerpad_max_install_names as suggested...
# I guess I lucked out, since the original location is actually a few characters shorter than the new one.
