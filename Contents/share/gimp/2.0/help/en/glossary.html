        An Alpha value indicates the transparency of a pixel. Besides its
        Red, Green and Blue values, a pixel has an alpha value. The smaller
        the alpha value of a pixel, the more visible the colors below it. A
        pixel with an alpha value of 0 is completely transparent. A pixel
        with an alpha value of 255 is fully opaque.

        With some image
        <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glossary-fileformat" title="File Format">file formats</a>, you can only
        specify that a pixel is completely transparent or completely opaque.
        Other file formats allow a variable level of transparency.

        An alpha <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glossary-channels" title="Channel">channel</a> of a layer
        is a grayscale image of the same size as the layer representing its
        transparency. For each pixel the gray level (a value between 0 and
        255) represents the pixels's
        <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glossary-alpha" title="Alpha">Alpha</a> value. An alpha channel
        can make areas of the layer to appear partially transparent. That's
        why the background layer has no alpha channel by default.
      </p>
          <p>
        The image alpha channel, which is displayed in the channels dialog,
        can be considered as the alpha channel of the final layer when all
        layers have been merged.

        Antialiasing is the process of reversing an alias, that is,
        reducing the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">jaggies</span>”</span>. Antialiasing
        produces smoother curves by adjusting the boundary between the
        background and the pixel region that is being antialiased. Generally,
        pixel intensities or opacities are changed so that a smoother
        transition to the background is achieved. With selections, the
        opacity of the edge of the selection is appropriately reduced.

        A spline is a curve which is defined mathematically and has a set of
        control points. A Bézier spline is a cubic spline which has
        four control points, where the first and last control points (knots or
        anchors) are the endpoints of the curve and the inner two control
        points (handles) determine the direction of the curve at the
        endpoints.
      </p>
          <p>
        In the non-mathematical sense, a spline is a flexible strip of wood or
        metal used for drawing curves. Using this type of spline for drawing
        curves dates back to shipbuilding, where weights were hung on splines
        to bend them. The outer control points of a Bézier spline are
        similar to the places where the splines are fastened down and the
        inner control points are where weights are attached to modify the
        curve.
      </p>
          <p>
        Bézier splines are only one way of mathematically representing
        curves. They were developed in the 1960s by Pierre Bézier, who
        worked for Renault.

            bitmap — A data file or structure which corresponds bit for

            format as it would be stored in the display's video memory or
            maybe as a device independent bitmap. A bitmap is characterised by
            the width and height of the image in pixels and the number of bits
            per pixel which determines the number of shades of grey or colors
            it can represent. A bitmap representing a colored image (a

            and eight bits for each of the red, green, and blue components,
            though other color encodings are also used. The green component
            sometimes has more bits than the other two to cater for the human
            eye's greater discrimination in this component.

        Bump mapping is a technique for displaying extremely detailed objects
        without increasing the geometrical complexity of the objects. It is
        especially used in 3-dimensional visualization programs. The trick is
        to put all the necessary information into a texture, with which
        shadowing is shown on the surface of the object.
      </p>
          <p>
        Bump mapping is only one (very effective) way of simulating surface
        irregularities which are not actually contained in the geometry of the
        model.

        A channel refers to a certain component of an image. For instance, the
        components of an <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glossary-rgb" title="RGB">RGB</a> image are the
        three primary colors red, green, blue, and sometimes transparency
        (alpha).
      </p>
          <p>
        Every channel is a grayscale image of exactly the same size as the
        image and, consequently, consists of the same number of pixels. Every
        pixel of this grayscale image can be regarded as a container which can
        be filled with a value ranging from 0 to 255. The exact meaning of
        this value depends on the type of channel, e.g. in the
        <acronym class="acronym">RGB</acronym> color model the value in the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span>-channel means the amount of red which is added
        to the color of the different pixels; in the selection channel, the
        value denotes how strongly the pixels are selected; and in the alpha
        channel the values denote how opaque the corresponding pixels are.

        The Clipboard is a temporary area of memory which is used to
        transfer data between applications or documents. It is used when you
        Cut, Copy or Paste data in <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>.
      </p>
          <p>
        The clipboard is implemented slightly differently under different
        operating systems. Under Linux/XFree, <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> uses
        the XFree clipboard for text and the <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
        internal image clipboard for transferring images between image
        documents. Under other operating systems, the clipboard may work
        somewhat differently. See the <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> documentation
        for your operating system for further information.
      </p>
          <p>
        The basic operations provided by the clipboard are
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Cut</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Copy</span>”</span>, and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Paste</span>”</span>.
        Cut means that the item is removed from the document and copied to
        the clipboard. Copy leaves the item in the document and copies it to
        the clipboard. Paste copies the contents of the clipboard to the
        document. The <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> makes an intelligent decision
        about what to paste depending upon the target. If the target is a
        canvas, the Paste operation uses the image clipboard. If the target
        is a text entry box, the paste operation uses the text clipboard.

        which has components for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black. It is a
        subtractive color model, and that fact is important when an image

          <p>
        The values of the individual colors vary between 0% and 100%, where 0%
        corresponds to an unprinted color, and 100% corresponds to a
        completely printed area of color. Colors are formed by mixing the
        three basic colors.
      </p>
          <p>
        The last of these values, K (Black), doesn't contribute to
        the color, but merely serves to darken the other colors.  The
        letter K is used for Black to prevent confusion, since B usually
        stands for Blue.

        This is the mode used in printing. These are the colors in the ink
        cartridges in your printer. It is the mode used in painting and in all
        the objects around us, where light is reflected, not emmitted. Objects
        absorb part of the light waves and we see only the reflected part.
        Note that the cones in our eyes see this reflected light in RGB mode.
        An object appears Red because Green and Blue have been absorbed. Since
        the combination of Green and Blue is Cyan, Cyan is absorbed when you
        add Red. Conversely, if you add Cyan, its complementary color, Red, is
        absorbed. This system is <span class="emphasis"><em>subtractive</em></span>.
        If you add Yellow, you decrease Blue, and if you add Magenta, you
        decrease Green.
      </p>
          <p>
        It would be logical to think that by mixing Cyan, Magenta and Yellow,
        you would subtract Red, Green and Blue, and the eye would see no light
        at all, that is, Black. But the question is more complex. In fact, you
        would see a dark brown. That is why this mode also has a Black value,
        and why your printer has a Black cartridge. It is less expensive that
        way. The printer doesn't have to mix the other three colors to create
        an imperfect Black, it just has to add Black.

        A color model is a way of describing and specifying a color. The term
        is often used loosely to refer to both a color space system and the
        color space on which it is based.
      </p>
          <p>
        A color space is a set of colors which can be displayed or
        recognized by an input or output device (such as a scanner, monitor,
        printer, etc.). The colors of a color space are specified as values
        in a color space system, which is a coordinate system in which the
        individual colors are described by coordinate values on various axes.
        Because of the structure of the human eye, there are three axes in
        color spaces which are intended for human observers. The practical
        application of that is that colors are specified with three
        components (with a few exceptions). There are about 30 to 40 color
        space systems in use. Some important examples are:

        Dithering is a technique used in computer graphics to create the
        illusion of more colors when displaying an image which has a low

        dithered image, the missing colors are reproduced by a certain
        arrangement of pixels in the available colors. The human eye
        perceives this as a mixture of the individual colors.

        The <a class="link" href="gimp-tool-blend.html" title="3.4. Blend">Gradient</a> tool uses

        image to <a class="link" href="gimp-image-convert-indexed.html" title="6.6. Indexed mode">Indexed</a>
        format. If you are working on an image with indexed colors, some
        tools (such as the pattern fill tool) may also use dithering, if the
        correct color is not available in the colormap.

        Exchangeable image file format (official abbreviation Exif, not
        EXIF) is a specification for the image file format used by digital
        cameras. It was created by the Japan Electronic Industry Development
        Association (JEIDA). The specification uses the existing JPEG, TIFF
        Rev. 6.0, and RIFF WAVE file formats, with the addition of specific
        metadata tags. It is not supported in JPEG 2000 or PNG. Version 2.1 of
        the specification is dated June 12, 1998 and version 2.2 is dated
        April 2002. The Exif tag structure is taken from that of TIFF files.
        There is a large overlap between the tags defined in the TIFF, Exif,
        TIFF/EP and DCF standards

        A file format or file type is the form in which computer data is
        stored. Since a file is stored by an operating system as a linear
        series of bytes, which cannot describe many kinds of real data in
        an obvious way, conventions have been developed for interpreting
        the information as representations of complex data. All of the
        conventions for a particular <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">kind</span>”</span> of file constitute
        a file format.
      </p>
          <p>
        Some typical file formats for saving images are JPEG, TIFF, PNG and
        GIF. The best file format for saving an image depends upon how the
        image is intended to be used. For example, if the image is intended
        for the internet, file size is a very important factor, and if the
        image is intended to be printed, high resolution and quality have
        greater significance. See

        A floating selection (sometimes called a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">floating

        published in 1976 by Robert W. Floyd and Louis Steinberg. The
        dithering process begins in the upper left corner of the image. For
        each pixel, the closest available color in the palette is chosen and
        the difference between that color and the original color is computed
        in each RGB channel. Then specific fractions of these differences
        are dispersed among several adjacent pixels which haven't yet been
        visited (below and to the right of the original pixel). Because of
        the order of processing, the procedure can be done in a single pass
        over the image.

        Gamma or gamma correction is a non-linear operation which is used to
        encode and decode luminance or color values in video or still image
        systems. It is used in many types of imaging systems to straighten out
        a curved signal-to-light or intensity-to-signal response. For example,
        the light emitted by a CRT is not linear with regard to its input
        voltage, and the voltage from an electric camera is not linear with
        regard to the intensity (power) of the light in the scene. Gamma
        encoding helps to map the data into a perceptually linear domain, so
        that the limited signal range (the limited number of bits in each RGB
        signal) is better optimized perceptually.
      </p>
          <p>
        Gamma is used as an exponent (power) in the correction equation. Gamma
        compression (where gamma &lt; 1) is used to encode linear luminance or
        RGB values into color signals or digital file values, and gamma
        expansion (where gamma &gt; 1) is the decoding process, and usually
        occurs where the current-to-voltage function for a CRT is non-linear.
      </p>
          <p>
        For PC video, images are encoded with a gamma of about 0.45 and
        decoded with a gamma of 2.2. For Mac systems, images are typically
        encoded with a gamma of about 0.55 and decoded with a gamma of 1.8.
        The sRGB color space standard used for most cameras, PCs and printers
        does not use a simple exponential equation, but has a decoding gamma
        value near 2.2 over much of its range.

        In color reproduction, including computer graphics and photography,
        the gamut, or color gamut (pronounced /ˈgæmət/), is a certain complete
        subset of colors. The most common usage refers to the subset of colors
        which can be accurately represented in a given circumstance, such as
        within a given color space or by a certain output device. Another
        sense, less frequently used but not less correct, refers to the
        complete set of colors found within an image at a given time. In this
        context, digitizing a photograph, converting a digitized image to a
        different color space, or outputting it to a given medium using a
        certain output device generally alters its gamut, in the sense that
        some of the colors in the original are lost in the process.

        (up to 256 different colors per image). Since GIF was developed, a

        (PNG)</a> has been developed, which is better than GIF in all

        features.

        GIF was introduced by CompuServe in 1987. It became popular mostly
        because of its efficient, LZW compression. The size of the image files
        required clearly less disk space than other usual graphics formats of
        the time, such as PCX or MacPaint. Even large images could be
        transmitted in a reasonable time, even with slow modems. In addition,
        the open licensing policy of CompuServe made it possible for any
        programmer to implement the GIF format for his own applications free
        of charge, as long as the CompuServe copyright notice was attached to
        them.
      </p>
          <p>
        Colors in GIF are stored in a color table which can hold up to 256
        different entries, chosen from 16.7 million different color values.
        When the image format was introduced, this was not a much of a
        limitation, since only a few people had hardware which could display
        more colors than that. For typical drawings, cartoons, black-and-white
        photographs and similar uses, 256 colors are quite sufficient as a
        rule, even today. For more complex images, such as color photographs,
        however, a huge loss of quality is apparent, which is why the format
        is not considered to be suitable for those purposes.
      </p>
          <p>
        One color entry in the palette can be defined to be transparent.
        With transparency, the GIF image can look like it is non-rectangular
        in shape. However, semi-transparency, as in
        <a class="link" href="gimp-images-out.html#file-png-save-defaults">PNG</a>, is not possible.
        A pixel can only be either entirely visible or completely
        transparent.
      </p>
          <p>
        The first version of GIF was 87a. In 1989, CompuServe published an
        expanded version, called 89a. Among other things, this made it
        possible to save several images in one GIF file, which is especially
        used for simple animation. The version number can be distinguished
        from the first six bytes of a GIF file. Interpreted as ASCII symbols,
        they are <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">GIF87a</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">GIF89a</span>”</span>.

        The GNU project was started in 1983 by Richard Stallman with the
        goal of developing a completely free operating system. It is
        especially well-known from the GNU General Public License (GPL) and
        GNU/Linux, a GNU-variant with a Linux kernel.
      </p>
          <p>
        The name came about from the naming conventions which were in
        practice at MIT, where Stallman worked at the time.
        For programs which were similar to other programs, recursive
        acronyms were chosen as names. Since the new system was to be based
        on the widespread operating system, Unix, Stallman looked for that
        kind of name and came up with GNU, which stands for
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">GNU is not Unix</span>”</span>. In order to avoid confusion, the
        name should be pronounced with the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">G</span>”</span>, not like
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">new</span>”</span>. There were several reasons for making GNU
        Unix-compatible. For one thing, Stallman was convinced that most
        companies would refuse a completely new operating system, if the
        programs they used wouldn't run on it. In addition, the architecture
        of Unix made quick, easy and distributed development possible,
        since Unix consists of many small programs that can be developed
        independently of each other, for the most part. Also, many parts of
        a Unix system were freely available to anyone and could therefore
        be directly integrated into GNU, for example, the typesetting
        system, TeX, or the X Window System. The missing parts were newly
        written from the ground up.

        gray.

        In digital image processing, a histogram is a graph representing the
        statistical frequency of the gray values or the color values in an
        image. The histogram of an image tells you about the occurrence of
        gray values or color values, as well as the contrast range and the
        brightness of the image. In a color image, you can create one
        histogram with information about all possible colors, or three
        histograms for the individual color channels. The latter makes the
        most sense, since most procedures are based on grayscale images and
        therefore further processing is immediately possible.

        pale pink, a dazzling red, etc. The HSV model takes these
        characteristics into account. HSV and RGB are not completely
        independent of each other. You can see that with the Color Picker
        tool; when you change a color in one of the color models, the other
        one also changes. Brave souls can read

        An image hose in <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> is a special type of brush
        which consists of several images. For example, you could have a
        brush with footprints, which consists of two images, one for the
        left footprint and one for the right. While painting with this
        brush, a left footprint would appear first, then a right footprint,
        then a left one, etc. This type of brush is very powerful.
      </p>
          <p>
        An image hose is also sometimes called an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">image pipe</span>”</span>
        or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">animated brush</span>”</span>. An image hose is indicated in the
        Brushes dialog by a small red triangle in the lower right corner of
        the brush's symbol.

        Incremental mode is a paint mode where each brush stroke is drawn
        directly on the active layer. When it is set, each additional stroke
        of the brush increases the effect of the brush, up to the maximum
        opacity for the brush.
      </p>
          <p>
        If incremental mode is not set, brush strokes are drawn on a canvas
        buffer, which is then combined with the active layer. The maximum
        effect of a brush is then determined by the opacity, and stroking with
        the brush repeatedly does not increase the effect beyond this limit.

        Incremental mode is a tool option that is shared by several brush
        tools, except those which have a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">rate</span>”</span> control, which
        automatically implies an incremental effect. You can set it by

        Indexed color mode is a mode for encoding colors in an image where
        each pixel in the image is assigned an 8-bit color number. The color
        which corresponds to this number is then put in a table (the palette).
        Changing a color in the palette changes all the pixels which refer
        to this palette color. Although you can create images in
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Indexed Color</em></span> mode and can transform images to
        it, it is, strictly speaking, not a

        JPEG is a <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glossary-fileformat" title="File Format">file format</a>
        which supports compression and works at all color depths. The
        image compression is adjustable, but beware: Too high a compression
        could severely reduce image quality, since JPEG compression is lossy.
      </p>
          <p>
        Use JPEG to create web graphics or if you don't want your
        image to take up a lot of space. JPEG is a good format for
        photographs and for computer-generated images (CGI). It is not well

          <p>
        In general, JPEG transformations are not reversible. Opening and
        then saving a JPEG file causes a new, lossy compression. Increasing
        the quality factor later will not bring back the image information
        which was lost.

        <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glossary-colormodel" title="Color model">color model</a>
        developed in the beginning of the 1930s by the Commission
        Internationale d`Eclairage (CIE). It includes all the colors that
        the human eye can perceive. That contains the colors of the
        RGB and the CMYK color spaces, among others. In Lab, a color is
        indicated by three values: L, a and b. Here, the L stands for the
        luminance component — corresponding to the gray value — and a and b
        represent the red-green and blue-yellow parts of the color,
        respectively.
      </p>
          <p>
        In contrast to RGB or CMYK, Lab is not dependent upon the
        various input and output devices. For that reason, it is used as an
        exchange format between devices. Lab is also the internal color
        model of PostScript Level II.

        A mask is like a veil put over a layer (layer mask) or all the layers
        of an image (selection mask). You can remove this mask by painting
        with white color, and you can complete it by painting with black
        color. When the mask is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">applied</span>”</span>, non masked pixels
        will remain visible (the others will be transparent) or will be
        selected, according to the type of mask.

            Every layer can have its own mask. The layer mask represents the
            Alpha channel of the layer and allows you to manage its
            transparency. By painting on the layer mask, you can make parts of
            the layer opaque or transparent: painting with black makes the
            layer transparent, painting with white makes the layer opaque and
            painting with shades of gray makes the layer semi-transparent. You
            can use all paint tools to paint on the mask. You can also apply a
            filter or copy-paste. You can use the Layer mask for transition
            effects, volume effects, merging elements from another image, etc.

        The moiré effect (pronounce <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Moa-ray</span>”</span>) is an
        unintended pattern which appears when a regular pattern of grids or
        lines interferes with another regular pattern placed over it. This can
        happen, for example, when you are scanning an image with a periodic
        structure (such as a checkered shirt or a half-toned image), scanning
        a digital image, taking a digital photograph of a periodic pattern,
        or even when silkscreening.

         If you discover the problem in time, the best solution is to move

        Created by Adobe, PostScript is a page description language mainly
        used by printers and other output devices. It's also an excellent way
        to distribute documents. <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> does not support

        The great power of PostScript is its ability to represent vector
        graphics—lines, curves, text, paths, etc.—in a resolution-independent
        way. PostScript is not very efficient, though, when it comes to
        representing pixel-based raster graphics. For this reason, PostScript
        is not a good format to use for saving images that are later going to
        be edited using <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> or another graphics program.

        Quantization is the process of reducing the color of a pixel into one
        of a number of fixed values by matching the color to the nearest color
        in the colormap. Actual pixel values may have far more precision than
        the discrete levels which can be displayed by a digital display. If
        the display range is too small, then abrupt changes in colors (false
        contours, or banding) may appear where the color intensity changes
        from one level to another. This is especially noticeable in Indexed
        images, which have 256 or fewer discrete colors.
      </p>

        RGB is a <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glossary-colormodel" title="Color model">color model</a>
        which has components for Red, Green and Blue. These colors are
        emitted by screen elements and not reflected as they are with paint.
        The resulting color is a combination of the three primary RGB colors,
        with different degrees of lightness. If you look closely at your
        television screen, whose pitch is less than that of a computer
        screen, you can see the red, green and blue elements lit with
        different intensities. The RGB color model is
        <span class="emphasis"><em>additive</em></span>.
      </p>
          <p><acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> uses eight bits per channel for each primary
        color. That means there are 256 intensities (Values) available,
        resulting in 256×256×256 = 16,777,216 colors.
      </p>
          <p>
        It is not obvious why a given combination of primary colors produces a
        particular color. Why, for instance, does 229R+205G+229B give a shade
        of pink? This depends upon the human eye and brain. There is no color
        in nature, only a continuous spectrum of wavelengths of light. There
        are three kinds of cones in the retina. The same wavelength of light
        acting upon the three types of cones stimulates each of them
        differently, and the mind has learned, after several million years of
        evolution, how to recognize a color from these differences.
      </p>
          <p>
        It is easy to see that no light (0R+0G+0B) produces complete darkness,
        black, and that full light (255R+255G+255B) produces white. Equal
        intensity on all color channels produces a level of gray. That is why
        there can only be 256 gray levels in <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>.

        Mixing two <span class="emphasis"><em>Primary colors</em></span> in RGB mode

        Yellow, Green and Blue give Cyan, Blue and Red give Magenta.
        Don't confuse secondary colors with

        It is important to know what happens when you are dealing with colors
        in <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>.
        The most important rule to remember is that decreasing the intensity
        of a primary color results in increasing the intensity of the
        complementary color (and vice versa). This is because when you
        decrease the value of a channel, for instance Green, you automatically
        increase the relative importance of the other two, here Red and Blue.
        The combination of these two channels gives the secondary color,
        Magenta, which is the complementary color of Green.

      Supersampling is a more sophisticated antialiasing technique, that
      is, a method of reducing jagged and stair-stepped edges along a
      slanted or curved line. Samples are taken at several locations
      <span class="emphasis"><em>within</em></span> each pixel, not just at the center, and
      an average color is calculated. This is done by rendering the image
      at a much higher resolution than the one being displayed and then
      shrinking it to the desired size, using the extra pixels for
      calculation. The result is a smoother transition from one line of
      pixels to another along the edges of objects.
    </p>
          <p>
      The quality of the result depends on the number of samples.
      Supersampling is often performed at a range of 2× to 16× the original
      size. It greatly increases the amount of time needed to draw the image
      and also the amount of space needed to store the image in memory.
    </p>

      One way to reduce the space and time requirement is to use Adaptive
      Supersampling. This method takes advantage of the fact that very few
      pixels are actually on an object boundary, so only those pixels need to
      be supersampled. At first, only a few samples are taken within a pixel.
      If the colors are very similar to each other, only those samples are
      used to calculate the final color. If not, more samples are used. This
      means that the higher number of samples is calculated only where
      necessary, which improves performance.

        SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a format for
        two-dimensional vector graphics, both static and animated. You can
        export GIMP paths to SVG and you can import SVG documents into GIMP
        from a vector graphic software. See

        TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a
        <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glossary-fileformat" title="File Format">file format</a> which was
        developed primarily for scanned
        raster graphics for color separation. Six different encoding routines
        are supported, each with one of three different image modes: black and
        white, grayscale and color. Uncompressed TIFF images may be 1, 4, 8 or
        24 bits per pixel. TIFF images compressed using the LZW algorithm may
        be 6, 8 or 24 bits per pixel. Besides Postscript format, TIFF is one
        of the most important formats for preliminary stages of printing. It
        is a high quality file format, which is perfect for images you want to
        import to other programs like FrameMaker or CorelDRAW.

        A Tile is a part of an image which <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
        currently has open. In order to avoid having to store an
        entire image in memory at the same time,
        <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> divides it into smaller pieces.
        A tile is usually a square of 64 x 64 pixels, although tiles at
        the edges of an image may be smaller than that.
      </p>
          <p>
        At any time, a tile may be in main memory, in the tile cache
        in RAM, or on disk. Tiles which are currently being worked on are
        in main memory. Tiles which have been used recently are in RAM.
        When the tile cache in RAM is full, tiles which have been used
        least recently are written to disk. <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
        can retrieve the tiles from RAM or disk when they are needed.

        A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that
        serves to identify an abstract or a physical resource. URIs are used
        for the identification of resources in the Internet (such as web
        pages, miscellaneous files, calling up web services, and for receivers
        of e-mail) and they are especially used in the Worldwide Web.

        URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are one type of Uniform Resource
        Identifiers (URIs). URLs identify a resource by its primary access
        mechanism (commonly http or ftp) and the location of the resource in
        the computer network. The name of the URI scheme is therefore
        generally derived from the network protocol used for it. Examples of
        network protocols are http, ftp and mailto.
      </p>
          <p>
        Since URLs are the first and most common kinds of URIs, the terms are
        often used synonymously.

        XCF is a <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glossary-fileformat" title="File Format">file format</a>
        which is special because it is <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>'s
        native file format: that is, it was designed specifically to store all
        of the data that goes to make up a <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> image.
        Because of this, XCF files may be quite complicated, and there are
        few programs other than <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> that can read them.
      </p>
          <p>
        When an image is stored as an XCF file, the file encodes nearly
        everything there is to know about the image: the pixel data for each
        of the layers, the current selection, additional channels if there are
        any, paths if there are any, and guides. The most important thing that
        is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> saved in an XCF file is the undo history.
      </p>
          <p>
        The pixel data in an XCF file is represented
        in a lossless compressed form: the image byte blocks are compressed
        using the lossless RLE algorithm. This means that no matter how many
        times you load and save an image using this format, not a single
        pixel or other image data is lost or modified because of this format.
        XCF files can become very large, however <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
        allows you to compress the files themselves, using either the gzip
        or bzip2 compression methods, both of which are fast, efficient, and
        freely available. Compressing an XCF file will often shrink it by a
        factor of 10 or more.
      </p>
          <p>
        The <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> developers have made a great effort to
        keep the XCF file format compatible across versions. If you create a
        file using <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> 2.0, it ought to be possible to
        open the file in <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> 1.2. However, some of the
        information in the file may not be usable: for example,
        <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> 2.0 has a much more sophisticated way of
        handling text than <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> 1.2, so a text layer
        from a <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> 2.0 XCF file will appear as an
        ordinary image layer if the file is opened in
        <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> 1.2.

        YCbCr is a <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glossary-colormodel" title="Color model">color model</a>
        which was developed for the PAL television standard as a simple
        modification to the YUV color model. In the
        meantime, it has become the CCIR-601 standard for image and video
        recording. For example, it is used for JPEG pictures and MPEG videos,
        and therefore also on DVDs, video CDs and for most other widespread
        digital video standards. Note that a color model is still not a color
        space, since it doesn't determine which colors are actually meant by
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">red</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">green</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">blue</span>”</span>.
        For a color space, there must still be a reference to a specific
        absolute color value.
      </p>
          <p>
        There are color models which do not express a color by the additive
        basic colors, red, green and blue (RGB), but by other properties, for
        example, the brightness-color model. Here, the criteria are the basic
        brightness of the colors (from black, through gray, to white), the
        colors with the largest portion (red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
        violet, or other pure colors that lie between them) and the saturation
        of the colors (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">gaudy</span>”</span> to pale). This color model is
        based on the
        ability of the eye to recognize small differences in luminosity
        better than small color differences, and to recognize those better
        than small differences in saturation. That makes gray text written on
        a black background easy to read, but blue text on a red background
        very hard to read, even with the same basic brightness. Such color
        models are called brightness-color models.
      </p>
          <p>
        The YCbCr model is a slight adaptation of such a brightness-color
        model. An RGB color value is divided into a basic brightness, Y, and
        two components, Cb and Cr, where Cb is a measurement of the deviation
        from gray in the blue direction, or if it is less than 0.5, in the
        direction of yellow. Cr is the corresponding measurement for the
        difference in the direction of red or turquoise. This representation
        uses the peculiarity of the eye of being especially sensitive to green
        light. That is why most of the information about the proportion of
        green is in the basic brightness, Y, an only the deviations for the
        red and blue portions need to be represented. The Y values have twice
        the resolution of the other two values, Cb and Cr, in most practical
        applications, such as on DVDs.

        YUV is a <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glossary-colormodel" title="Color model">color model</a>
        which uses two components to represent the color
        information, luma (the strength of the light per area) and the
        chrominance, or proportion of color (chroma), where the chrominance
        again consists of two components. The development of the YUV color
        model also goes back to the development of color television (PAL),
        where ways were sought for transmitting the color information
        along with the black-and-white signal, in order to achieve backwards
        compatibility with old black and white televisions without having to
        increase the available transmission bandwidth. From the YUV color
        model of the analog television techiques, the YCrCb color model was
        developed, which is used for most kinds of digital image and video
        compression. Erroneously, the YUV color model is also often spoken
        about in those fields, although the YCbCr model is actually used.
        This often causes confusion.
      </p>
          <p>
        For the calculation of the luma signals, the underlying RGB data is
        first adjusted with the <a class="link" href="glossary.html#glossary-gamma" title="Gamma">gamma</a>
        value of the output device, and an R'G'B' signal is obtained. The
        three individual components are added together with different
        weights, to form the brightness information, which also functions as
        the VBS signal (Video Baseband Signal, the black-and-white signal)
        for the old black and white televisions.
      </p>
          <p>Y=R+G+B</p>
          <p>
        The exact calculation is more complicated, however, since some aspects
        of the color perception of the human eye have to be taken into
        account. For example, green is perceived to be lighter than red, and
        this is perceived to be lighter than blue. Furthermore, in some
        systems gamma correction of the basic color is first performed.
      </p>
          <p>
        The chrominance signals, and the color difference signals also,
        contain the color information. They are formed by the difference of
        blue minus luma or red minus luma.
      </p>
          <p>U=B-Y</p>
          <p>V=R-Y</p>
          <p>
        From the three generated components, Y, U and V, the individual
        color proportions of the basic color can be calculated again later:
      </p>
          <p>Y + U = Y + ( B - Y ) = Y - Y + B = B</p>
          <p>Y + V = Y + ( R - Y ) = Y - Y + R = R</p>
          <p>Y - B - R = ( R + G + B ) - B - R = G</p>
          <p>
        Furthermore, because of the structure of the retina of the human
        eye, it turns out that the brightness information is perceived at a
        higher resolution than the color, so that many formats based on
        the YUV color model compress the chrominance to save bandwidth
        during transmission.
