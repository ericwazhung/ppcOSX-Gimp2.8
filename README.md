# ppcOSX-Gimp2.8
This is a fully-compiled and (hopefully) fully-self-contained version of The Gimp 2.8 for Mac OSX 10.5.8 PPC. THIS IS A HACK-JOB

This *should* contain all the necessary libraries, but no promises.

This was *definitely* a hack-job by someone who *barely* knew what he was doing (me). 
Further, that system (my only PPC) bit the dust over a year ago, and this was recovered from a backup.

But, last I checked it worked, with a few bugs... (See the file _Readme.txt)
 Mainly: In all text-boxes, must select "None" as the input-method (right-click)
 And, I don't think you can save-as a jpg...


I think all's you'll have to do is click the "Download Zip" and extract it to a new folder (might have to name it Gimp2.8.app) then move that to your Applications folder.

This was put-together from macports...

Let me know if you find this useful, or have any thoughts/experiences to add here!
